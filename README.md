**Fast unit switching for Passive House designers**

PH-Switch is a specialized unit conversion tool designed specifically for Passive House professionals. It provides instant, precise conversions for the most commonly used units in building physics and energy modeling.

## Quick Start

### üåê **Live Application**

**Try PH-Switch: [https://bldgtyp.github.io/ph-switch/](https://bldgtyp.github.io/ph-switch/)**

The latest version is always available through GitHub Pages - no installation required! You can also use Google Chrome to install PH-Switch as a PWA for even easier use.

### Try it Live

1. Type a conversion like "5 meters to feet"
2. See instant results: "16.4042 feet"
3. Click the result to copy "16.4042" to clipboard
4. Paste the numeric value anywhere you need it

### Example Conversions

```
5 meters to feet          ‚Üí 16.4042 feet
100 cfm to m¬≥/h          ‚Üí 169.9011 m¬≥/h
20¬∞C to ¬∞F               ‚Üí 68¬∞F
1000 Btu to kWh          ‚Üí 0.2931 kWh
50 Pa to inH2O           ‚Üí 0.2008 inH2O
```

## Features

### üöÄ **Instant Conversions**

Type natural language conversions like "5 meters to feet" or "100 cfm to m¬≥/h" and get immediate results.

### üìã **Smart Copy-to-Clipboard**

Click any result to copy just the numeric value (without units) directly to your clipboard - perfect for pasting into spreadsheets, calculations, or other applications.

### üéØ **Category-Aware AutoSuggest**

Intelligent suggestions that filter units based on compatibility. When you type "5 m to f", only length units starting with "f" are suggested, not airflow or other incompatible units.

### üìù **Multi-line Support**

Process multiple conversions at once:

```
5 meters to feet
100 cfm to m¬≥/h
20¬∞C to ¬∞F
```

### üè† **Passive House Focused**

Comprehensive unit support for building physics including:

- **Length**: meters, feet, inches, millimeters
- **Area**: m¬≤, ft¬≤, in¬≤
- **Volume**: m¬≥, ft¬≥, liters, gallons
- **Airflow**: cfm, m¬≥/h, l/s, ft¬≥/min
- **Energy**: kWh, Btu, kJ, Wh
- **Power**: watts, kW, Btu/h, tons
- **Temperature**: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin
- **Pressure**: Pa, psi, inH2O, bar
- **And many more...**
